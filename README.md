This is my first Javascript mini project, that I made for practice, and understanding basic JS.


Featues of this Dice Rolling Game:-

2. 2 players can play this game.
3. First, the players need to click on player names(e.g Player 1), upon which they get a prompt box, where they can write their names.
4. Setting player names are optional for this game.
5. Players can click on "Roll" button to play the game and see who wins.
6. The turns are based upon Random function.
7. Players can play the game again and again using the simple "Play Again" button, without the need to refresh the page for playing many times.
